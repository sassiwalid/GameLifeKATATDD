# GameLifeKATA-TDD

A demo project that solve the Game of Life  kata by implementing Unit Test using XCTest framework of Apple.

 ## Requirements 
* Xcode 11.3
* Mac Os Catalina
* Swift 5
 
 ## Problem description
 The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. 
It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.
### Rules
1. Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
